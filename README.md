# e-commerce

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:


The e-commerce project was about completing back end routes to make the project functional.  The main challenge was creating each route to fit each function of searching, updating, or destroying.  The biggest challenge of this project was mainting a keen eye for detail and looking for mistakes once the code was written.  There were a lot of going between insomnia and VScode when encoutering an error.
